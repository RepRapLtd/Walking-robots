# RepRap Ltd Enhancements and Modifications to the Petoi Bittle Walking Robot

The [Petoi Bittle Robot Dog](https://www.petoi.com/pages/bittle-open-source-bionic-robot-dog) is a servo driven quadruped robot with an Arduino controller. But it also allows you to turn the Arduino inside it off and instead plug in a Raspberry Pi. This allows much more sophisticated control with essentially no space limitations on the size of the software driving the robot.
